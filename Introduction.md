# Introduction
# Our Group's name is FLO, which is based off of our last names, and our groups project is going to be based off of what section of pittsburgh is the cleanest one. To understand this, we decided that we should have each member of the group research a different section that either contributes to a place being greener or makes a place less environmentally friendly. The 3 sections our team researched was the density of trees in different counties of Pittsburgh, A census of where Illegal dumping of either hazardous or non decomposing materials took place, and finally, where parks are located.
